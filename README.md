For this CA2 we started by building our react app to run our project.

We built all thing that we needed, create a project in the project to work on.

In this second project we created a folder components where we are going to store every CRUD actions 

We reuse the code that we used for the CA1 to store complex datas for the project

Atleast when we are connected to the mongo db database we try every crud actions, when they all work your done
